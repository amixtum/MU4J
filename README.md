Music Utilities for Java

This is an idea right now. I'm in the process of writing some of the initial framework however.

What I plan for this library to be is a simple way for Java programmers and musicians who know a bit of Java to write in a language that's familiar to them i.e. with notes, measures, parts, and possibly more as the project progresses.

In addition, my initial inspiration for creating this library was for easy integration with synthesis frameworks and for use in programmatic music generation. A lot of what I will write will probably include utilities for dealing with music theory and frequencies as well.
